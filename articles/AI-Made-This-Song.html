    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">This song was completely computer generated. Everything you see and hear came from an algorithm or neural network.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The lyrics were generated by Open AI's ChatGPT. As with anything involving AI, it required some prompting to get a good result, though other than some metering problems, the first draft was the same as the final draft. The melody was also generated by ChatGPT, though it required many revisions to not end up with a jumble of random notes. The bass part was generated by ChatGPT as well, and also required several revisions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">After getting permission by GPT 3.5, I created the drum track myself.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The backtrack was all computer generated synth, using one of many online services such as Flat.io or Noteflight</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The original plan was to use an AI generated vioce and a vocoder to conform the spoken lyric to pitch, but after much searching, I copncluded that there was no good options for that. Instead, I used Yamaha's VOCALIOD 6 AI singer. It is a paid program, but I finished the project before the 30 day trail period had ended.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The Video was made using the free version of <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">DaVinci Resolve</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion web ui</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLive">DeepFaceLive</a>, and <a href="https://ebsynth.com/"></a>Ebsynth Beta</a></p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">A reference video was deep faked using DeepFaceLive, Stable Diffusion was used to generate reference frames, and EbSynth was used to apply the generated style the the whole video. DaVinci Resolve was used to cut the clips together.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The intro was made by generating a face in Stable Diffusion and running it through DeepFaceLive's face animatior.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">The album art was generated by Stable Diffusion, and edited in GIMP according to ChatGPT's instructions.</p>
    <br><p></p></br>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:left;">In Conclusion, many parts of this project would have been easier if I had done it myself. Getting it to give a decent first draft is easy, but going from first draft to final result takes exponentially longer, especially in music.</p>
