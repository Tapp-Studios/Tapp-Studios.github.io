    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:centeleft;">This song was completely computer generated. Everything you see and hear came from an algorithm or neural network.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:centeleft;">The lyrics were generated by Open AI's ChatGPT. As with anything involving AI, it required some prompting to get a good result, though other than some metering problems, the first draft was the same as the final draft. The melody was also generated by ChatGPT, though it required many revisions to not end up with a jumble of random notes. The bass part was generated by ChatGPT as well, and also required several revisions.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:centeleft;">After getting permission by GPT 3.5, I created the drum track myself.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; text-align:centeleft;">The backtrack was all computer generated synth, using one of many online services such as Flat.io or Noteflight</p>
